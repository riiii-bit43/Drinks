                    Dear Bestfriend,<br><br>
                    It still feels unbelievable that you are so far away from me, studying in Russia. Even though we are not together every day like before, I want you to know one thing  our bond will never change.

You are not just my best friend. You are my sister, my soulmate, and my biggest strength. For the last 15 years, we have laughed together, cried together, fought a little, but loved a lot. We grew up side by side, and every memory with you is like a treasure to me.

I miss our random talks, our long walks, our late-night chats, and the way we understood each other without even speaking. But even from miles away, I still feel your presence with me. Whenever something good happens, you are the first person I want to tell. And whenever I feel low, I still look for your comfort.

I know you are working hard there, chasing your dreams and I’m so proud of you. Sometimes it must be tough, sometimes you might feel lonely, but please remember I am always with you, just a message away. Distance can never change our friendship. It can only make it stronger.

Our friendship is not about being together every day. It’s about feeling connected even when we are far apart. And I know, no matter where life takes us, we will always find our way back to each other.

Thank you for being my constant support, my safe place, and my favorite person. I’m waiting for the day you return so we can make thousands of new memories again.

Till then, keep shining. I’m always proud of you. I love you endlessly.<br><br>

       -With all my heart, <br>
          Your Bestfriend who's waiting for you to come back home.
                </p>
